				ECHO "Pets are part of the family, and having a pet around gives you joy. As a family, you have to take care of your pet just as you do for other family members. Just like everyone, even pets need to see the doctor, monitoring the petâ€™s health is important to make sure the pet is as healthy as possible. You should get your pet to the veterinary clinic on a regular basis to avoid serious problems. Many problems if detected early can be caught and treated before turning into big diseases. Like humans, a pet cannot talk and therefore it is necessary to observe activities of a pet to know whether he is fine or not. You need to be a bit cautious with pets and if you find any abnormal condition rush to the veterinary hospital to avoid severe circumstances.<br>";
